        </div>
        <p> Hello, I'm Eric LEDUC, a brand new French Game Designer at Supinfogame. To introduce myself quickly, I was born and grew up in the North of France. I had my high school diploma in science in 2015. Since I played my first game ever at the age of six (Harry Potter 1 on GameBoy Advanced) I always knew I wanted to develop the stories I had started to come up with, through the years and all those hours spent on video games / pen and paper RPG / board games, I had to find a way to <b>tell a story to build the story of my life as a professional</b>, don't you think ? It was pretty obvious to me, so I did everything I could to make my dream come true. I'm currently in my 3rd year as a Junior Game Designer, I still can't believe I have the chance to do what I love for a living. By creating games and universes, I can see the the thrill in the players' eyes which is just extremely satisfying. I'm more like an experimental guy. Since the age of 2, trying to climb my cradle up to now, coding and designing to create my own universes, rules and games. I'm a Game Designer, trying to maintain good skills in writting, coding and managing. I'm continuously looking for experiences and knowledge about everything. I've always wanted to try things by myself because I can't know the truth if I don't try. I had two passions in my childhood, sports and games. Looks like one in stronger than the other one ! When I'm motivated about something, when something blows my mind and makes me dream, I can't help it but to become more and more into that project !</p>

            <h3 style="h3-responsive">Experiences</h3>
        </div>
        <p> As a student, you can imagine that I'm more looking for experiences to build on later rather than exposing my past projects. Nevertheless I still had some really interesting experiences. I created a boardgame with three friends. It's called <b><a href = "products/product.html">Ha'Garta</a></b>. This is certainly the most accomplished project I have done until now. My friends and I presented it in a lot of conventions, with the goal of finding an editor. That introduced directly to the professional world, because I had to manage a budget for my team and speak with professionals. The best part of it is that we were selected for the International Festival of Boardgames In Cannes, in the young creator category. An other very cool project is a school work I did in a team of eight during eight months. <b><a href ="products/product_Bayou.html"> Bayou </a></b> is a 2D RPG, directly inspired by the old Zelda games. As a true Game Designer, I also learned a lot through the practice of softwares like Unity with friends, just check out <b><a href ="products/product_NEDL.html">Never Ending Disco Love </a></b>. I did also some rep work for different teams and developpers, especially at the Paris Games Week in multiple booths.</p>

        </div>
        <p> I'm a super motivated guy, trying to enjoy life through doing what I love in my work and in my free-time. I have as a personal goal to never stop being curious and always seek new experiences to improve my skills. I like to think my ideas and my choice over and over again to have to best result possible. I try to be the most efficient as possible to help my current and future team-mates. Thanks to the experiences I had as an animator I'm sociable and I always try to adapt to the universe / team I work with. I'm a Game Designer, with skills in writting, coding, software and management. </p>
