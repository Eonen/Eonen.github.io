        </div>
        <p> Hello, I'm Eric LEDUC, a brand new French Game Designer at Supinfogame. To introduce myself quickly, I'm born and I grown up in the North of France. I had my high school diploma in science in 2015. Since I played my first game ever at the age of six (Harry Potter 1 on GameBoy Advanced) I always knew I wanted to create or invant things, with the years and all thoses hours spent on video games / RPG pen and paper / board Games, there were no other solution that <b>work by passion to live</b>, don't you think ? It was pretty obvious for me, so i did everything possible to make my dream come true. I'm Currently in my 3th as a Junior Game Designer, I still can't believe I have the chance to do what I love for living. Creating games and univers, give fun and interest to people is just something beautiful. I'm more like an experimental guy. Since the age of 2, trying to climb my cradle to now, coding and designing to create my own univers, rules and games. I'm a Game Designer, trying to maintain good skills in writting, coding and managing. I'm continuously seeking for experiences,knowledges about everything. I always wanted to try things by myself because I can't know the truth if I don't try. I had two passions in my childhood, sports and games. Looks like one in stronger than the other one ! When I'm motivated about something, when something blew my mind and make me dream, I can't stop my motivation to grow continuously and to do what I have to do to make my dream come true !</p>

        </div>
        <p> As a student, you can image that I'm more looking for experiences than I can speak about my own professional experiences. Even so (Notwithstanding ?) I had some really interesting experiences. I create a Board Game with three friends. It's call <b><a href = "...">Ha'Garta</a></b>. This is certainly the most accomplished project I have done until now. Me and my friends did a lots a convention, with the goal of finding an Editor. That make me go directly in the professional world, because I had to provide a budget for my team and speak with professional. What can be noticable is that we were selected for the International festival of Board Games of Cannes, in the young creator category. An Other very cool project is a school work I did in a team of eight during eight month. <b><a href ="..."> Bayou </a></b> is a 2D RPG, direcly inspired by the old Zelda games. And a lot more just by practicing software like Unity with friends, check out <b><a href ="...">Never Ending Disco Love </a></b>. I did also some animation mission, specially at the Paris Games Week in multiple stand.</p>
